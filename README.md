The scoreboard displays all online players along with their character names, current jobs, and server IDs in an organized list. Additionally, it features a job tracking panel that shows real-time counts of players in configurable whitelisted jobs such as police, EMS, mechanics, and more.

Built with both functionality and aesthetics in mind, Purple Scoreboard is fully compatible with ESX and QBCore frameworks and automatically detects which one your server is using.

It can be customised via the config. Have fun!
